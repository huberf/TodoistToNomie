# Todoist to Nomie
*This is a work in progress but is functional*
This Python service couples with the [Tjjasdjflakj

## Setup
* This service needs two things: a Todoist developer app key with your user
  token and a Nomie Pro API key
* First, you will need to follow the "Todoist Oath" instructions to get an
  `access_token`. Once completed put this value in an environent variable called
  `TODOIST_USER_TOKEN`.
* Now, put your Nomie Pro API key in an environment variable called
  `NOMIE_API_KEY`
* Run the web.py script with Python 2.7 by executing `python web.py` in the
  project directory.
* Now configure your Todoist app to accept webhooks at
  `http://[YOUR_HOST_NAME].com/todoist`
* Live long and prosper.

## Todoist OAuth
* First create a Todoist application in the dasbhoard (instructions coming soon).
* Now insert your client_id and client_secret into the `todoist_auth.py` file.
* Then, run `python todoist_auth.py` and follow the instructions.
* Now pluck the "access_token" from the response and jump back to the setup
  steps.
